    <h1>IP Addresses</h1>
    <p>An address is a number that’s unique to each device on the network. An IP address is a device’s specific address. Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long, consisting of four different parts. The first part of the address specifies the country/network. The second part of the address specifies the region/network, and the third is the subnetwork. The fourth and last part of the IP address is the specific device (a laptop). This version of IP addressing is IPv4. IPv6 is a newer IP addressing version, which is 128 bits long.
    </p>
    <h2>Packets</h2>
    <p>Information goes from one computer to another in packets. A variety of digital information can be sent with IP packets. If information is too large to be sent all at once, the information can be broken up and delivered in the form of multiple packets. Packets use IP addresses to know where it came from and where it's going.
    </p>
    <h3>Routing</h3>
    <p>Routers are special computers on the internet that keep packets moving smoothly and efficiently. They manage multiple paths for sending packets and choose the simplest path to send a specific packet based on the packet’s destination IP addresses.

        <p>Multiple devices are shown above. Each of these devices has their own IP address, which is utilized when routing packages. If information was being sent from the tablet to the laptop pictured above, the information would be stored in packets and sent down a path determined by the router, using the tablet and laptop's IP addresses. </p>
