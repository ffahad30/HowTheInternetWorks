    <h1>W3C</h1>
    <p>W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium. W3C consists of member organizations, staff and the public who develop web standards. Its mission is to “lead the Web to its full potential.” W3C is funded by member dues, research grants, private and public funding, sponsorship and donations.
    </p>
    <p>W3C develops protocols and guidelines to ensure the maintenance, growth and efficiency of the web. W3C also works with the standardization of the web by developing standards based on community consensus.
    </p>
    <p>W3C's Design Policies include Web for All (Web Accessibility, Internationalization) and Web on Everything (Web of Devices, Mobile Web Initiative, Browsers and Other Agents).
    </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the language that is used to tell a web browser how to make a page look. For instance, HTML is used to determine a page’s font, color, image alignment, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It shows how HTML elements are physically displayed on a webpage. We use CSS to control the layout of multiple pages simultaneously. On CSS, you can personalize the design and layout of your page including font size, background color, navigation bars, etc.
